## Welcome to the Study

Thank you for participating in this research on human reasoning. In this study, you will be presented with a series of visual tasks, each governed by a hidden rule. Your goal is to think aloud as you observe each image and attempt to infer the rule behind it. Exact instructions will be given if you choose to continue with the study.

The study will take approximately **20 minutes** to complete. Your microphone will only record during the task phases when you are viewing the images and verbalising your thoughts. You must be comfortable speaking English throughout the study. If you do not feel comfortable speaking aloud or do not have access to a working microphone, please exit the study now.
