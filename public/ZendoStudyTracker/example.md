## Example: What Makes the Star Appear?

Each puzzle shows six visual scenes made of cone-shaped objects.

Some panels will display a **yellow star** in the top corner. This means the arrangement in that panel **follows the hidden rule**.

If the star is missing, that panel **does not follow the rule**.

---

Below is an example showing some panels that light up the star and some that don’t.

</p>

As you look at these panels, your task is to **observe what they have in common** and what might be different in the ones without a star.

You won’t be told the rule. You will have to try and figure it out by comparing the panels and reasoning aloud.

## Thinking Aloud Step by Step

Remember, when thinking aloud, you do not need to be right. Just speak clearly about what you notice, what you’re testing, and how your thinking changes as you go. The goal is to show your reasoning process, not just your final answer.

Let’s walk through how a participant might think aloud during a task like this:

> “Looking at **Panel B**, there's one green cone and it’s tilted, and there’s a star.”
>
> “**Panel D** has one red cone, also tilted, and also has a star.”
>
> “So maybe it’s about **tilt**? Both are not upright…”

This participant starts by describing what they see and forming an initial hypothesis based on shared features.

> “But then **Panel A** has two cones that are tilted, but no star. Hmm.”
>
> “Maybe it could be something about **color combinations** instead?”
>
> “**Panel B** is green, **Panel D** is red, and both have stars.”
>
> “**Panel A** has both red and green, but no star.”
>
> “Could it be: **you can have red or green, but not both together**?”

Now they’re considering an alternative explanation, testing and revising their thoughts based on what they observe.

> “That might explain **A**… but I’m not totally convinced.”
>
> “Maybe it could be about the **number of cones that are tilted**. Maybe only one should be tilted, not two like in **Panel A**. That could be a rule.”
>
> “Or maybe **all** of the cones in a scene have to be tilted, and having one upright cone in **Panel A** breaks the rule.”
>
> “So maybe it’s not about color. Maybe the rule is: **none of the cones can be upright**?”
>
> “That would fit. **Panels B and D** are fully tilted and have stars. **A and C** both have at least one upright cone, and no star.”
>
> “Yeah, that seems more consistent.”
>
> “Still, I’ll note the idea that maybe only one cone should be tilted, or the red-and-green color combination breaks the rule as lower-confidence guesses, just in case.”

In this example, the participant worked through the task by forming an initial idea, testing it against different panels, and considering other possibilities when contradictions appeared.

This is the kind of thoughtful, verbal reasoning we’re looking for.
Even guesses that turn out to be wrong are valuable if they reflect your thought process.
Just keep observing, testing ideas, and explaining your thinking out loud.

### Entering Your Guesses

Once you've finished thinking aloud, or once the 2-minute minimum has passed, a textbox will appear where you can type in your guesses about the hidden rule.

If you came up with more than one possible rule, feel free to list them all, in order of how likely you think they are.

Example: when asked to guess, you'll see a box like this in which you can write your guess or guesses from most to least likely.

  <strong>Important Reminder:</strong> Your responses and think-aloud recording will be reviewed. Occasional pauses are fine, as we understand there are moments when you may feel stuck or unsure what to say. However, if your recording contains prolonged periods of silence or shows no meaningful attempt to reason about the task, your submission <strong>may be rejected</strong>.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
  That said, there is <strong>no "correct" way to think aloud</strong>.
  As long as you continuously voice your thoughts and stay focused on figuring out the hidden rule, you are doing it right!
