## Use the Time to Think Freely

For each puzzle, you’ll view six panels and be asked to think aloud for **at least 2 minutes** before you can submit any guesses.
This gives you time to fully explore your ideas. If you are still unsure after 2 minutes, you can continue reasoning for as long as you as you would like.

Even if you come up with an idea early on, we encourage you to **keep reasoning throughout the full time**. You may find other possible rules as you keep reasoning!

### Don’t Stop at Your First Guess

Often, your first idea might seem to explain the scenes, but by continuing to explore, you may notice:

- Exceptions that don’t fit your initial guess.
- Better or simpler rules that also work.
- Alternative explanations you hadn’t considered.

Think of it like brainstorming: don’t stop at your first answer, try to generate as many possibilities as you can.

### Entering Your Guesses

Once the 2-minute think-aloud period ends:

- A textbox will appear for you to type in your **rule guess or guesses**.
- You can list **more than one** idea if you have them.
- If you are listing more than one idea, write them in order of how confident you are.

Example:
- “All cones are upright.”
- “There’s at least one red cone.”
- “One cone of each color.”

Use your time to **explore, compare, and revise** your ideas. The more you think out loud, the better!
