## Thinking Aloud

A key part of this study involves **thinking aloud** as you work through each puzzle.

This means you should **continuously speak your thoughts out loud**, even if you are unsure or still figuring things out. We want to hear your full reasoning process, not just the final answer.

### How to Think Aloud

As you view the six panels, you may say things like:

- “Panel A has a red cone on top of a blue one...”
- “Maybe the rule is about cone size?”
- “Panels C and D both have two green cones...maybe that matters?”

You don’t need to speak perfectly or use technical terms, just say what you are noticing, considering, or wondering about.

### Help Us Understand You Clearly

To make your audio more useful, please:

- Refer to specific panels by their labels (e.g., “Panel B”, “Panel F”).
- Speak clearly and at a normal pace.
- Stay focused on the task, avoid long silences or unrelated comments.

Remember: we’re not judging your accuracy. We’re interested in **how you think**. You will have time to explore your thoughts, try not to rush to a single answer.
