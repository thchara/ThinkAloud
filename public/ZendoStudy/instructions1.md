## Understanding the Task

In this study, you will complete a series of puzzles, each made up of visual scenes with different arrangements of **2D triangular-shaped objects (cones)**.

Each puzzle consists of six panels, labeled **A to F**, showing cones that vary in color, size, and orientation.  
Each panel will either **follow** or **not follow** a hidden rule, which is indicated by the presence of a **star** in the top corner.  
An example will be shown before the task begins.

Your goal is to figure out **what the hidden rule is** by observing patterns and using your reasoning skills.
