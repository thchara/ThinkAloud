## Use the Time to Think Freely

For each puzzle, use the 2 minutes to fully explore your ideas. Think of the timer as a thinking period, not a deadline. It is designed to give you room to reason aloud and consider different ideas before committing to a guess.

Even if you come up with an idea early on, we encourage you to **keep reasoning throughout the full time**. You may find other possible rules as you keep reasoning!

### Don’t Stop at Your First Guess

Often, your first idea might seem to explain the scenes, but by continuing to explore, you may notice:

- Exceptions that don’t fit your initial guess.
- Better or simpler rules that also work.
- Alternative explanations you hadn’t considered.

Think of it like brainstorming: don’t stop at your first answer, try to generate as many possibilities as you can.

#### Final Guess Submission (After the 2-Minute Timer Ends)

You can enter your final guess or guesses after the 2 minutes are over.

- You can list as many guesses as you want, especially if you are unsure.
- If you submit more than one guess, write them in order from **most to least confident**.
- These guesses do not have to be correct, they should reflect your best reasoning based on the puzzle.

Use your time to **explore, compare, and revise** your ideas. The more you think out loud, the better!
