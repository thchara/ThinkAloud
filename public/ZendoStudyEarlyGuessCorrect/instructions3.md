## Use the Time to Think Freely

For each puzzle,you will view five panels and be asked to think aloud for **2 minutes** before you can submit your final guesses.
This will give you time to fully explore your ideas.

Even if you come up with an idea early on, we encourage you to **keep reasoning throughout the full time**. You may find other possible rules as you keep reasoning!

---

### Don’t Stop at Your First Guess

Often, your first idea might seem to explain the scenes, but by continuing to explore, you may notice:

- Exceptions that don’t fit your initial guess.
- Better or simpler rules that also work.
- Alternative explanations you hadn’t considered.

Think of it like brainstorming: don’t stop at your first answer, try to generate as many possibilities as you can.

### Entering Your Guesses

#### Early Guess Option (After 1 Minute)

After you’ve been thinking aloud for **1 minute**, a textbox will appear allowing you to enter one early guess, if you feel confident in a rule.

- This guess is optional. You can submit it if you’re confident, or simply continue thinking aloud.
- If your guess is **correct**, the task will move on to the next puzzle.
- If it’s **incorrect**, you must continue reasoning until the full 2 minutes are up.

Submitting an early guess is a chance to “bookmark” your current thinking, but your goal is to keep testing, revising, and considering alternative explanations.

If you choose to submit an early guess, continue the study by asking yourself:

- Does this idea still fit all the panels?
- Are there counterexamples I haven’t explained?
- Could there be a better or more complete rule?

You’ll have another chance to submit your best ideas at the end of the timer.

#### Final Guess Submission (After the 2-Minute Timer Ends)

Once the 2-minute think-aloud period ends:

- A new textbox will appear where you can enter your **final rule guess or guesses**.
- You can list as many guesses as you want, especially if you are unsure.
- If you submit more than one guess, write them in order from **most to least confident**.
- These guesses do not have to be correct, they should reflect your best reasoning based on the puzzle.

Example:
- “All cones are upright.”
- “There’s at least one red cone.”
- “One cone of each color.”

You may continue reasoning aloud even after the timer ends, if you want more time to reflect before submitting your answer.

Use your time to **explore, compare, and revise** your ideas. The more you think out loud, the better!
