### Tracking your ideas

As you think aloud through the puzzles, you will be given access to a an optional tool of writing down some of your early ideas or guesses.

A small textbox will be shown on the side of the screen where you can write down any rule ideas or observations you come up with while thinking aloud.  
Clicking **“Add”**, or pressing **Enter** on your device's keyboard, saves the idea into a visible list on the side of the screen during the task.

You can use it to:
- Keep track of different hypotheses you’re considering.
- Compare earlier and later ideas more easily.

You do not have to use it, but it’s available if you find it helpful.

This tool is meant to help you, but it’s **not a replacement for thinking aloud**.  
Please continue to **speak your thoughts clearly and continuously**, just as you did in the earlier tasks.

### Example Idea Tracker

Here’s an example of what it might look like in use:

</p>

Example entries:
- “cones are tilted”  
- “red and green together, no star”  
- “only one cone tilted?”

These are just quick notes. Your reasoning out loud is still the most important part of the task.
